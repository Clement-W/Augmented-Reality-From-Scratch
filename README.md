Augmented reality project made for the C07SFTS0 Image Processing course at ENSC - Bordeaux INP.
The aim of this project was to change the content of a paper sheet, moved on a table by a hand, and add a 3d content on it.

To do so, these image processing algorithms have been implemented from scratch in matlab :
* Harris corner detector (Variational and statistical analysis)
* Multiscale Harris corner detector
* Linear tracking of points
* Space transformation (homography and 3d to 2d projection)
* Incrustation of new content
