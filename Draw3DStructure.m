% This function draw a 3D structure on a frame of the video

% Inputs:
% imgVideo = A frame from the video, on which we draw a 3d structure
% X2D = The x coordinates of the selected points on the video (corners of the paper sheet + corners of the lego structures displayed on the sheet)
% Y2D = The y coordinates of the selected points on the video
% numFrame = The number of the frame that is processed (used to create the movment of the structure as a function of time)

% Output :
% imgVideo = The same frame but with a 3d structure drawn on it

function imgVideo = Draw3DStructure(imgVideo, X2D, Y2D, numFrame)
